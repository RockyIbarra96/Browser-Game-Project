# Browser-Game-Project


## Description

The Game is Tic-Tac-Toe. I chose this game because it seemed the least complicated option. 


## Deployment

The web game is deployed at https://rockyibarra96.github.io/.


## Game Logic

```

Instructions: 
Press the "START" button to begin a new game. 
You are player one.
Use the mouse and click on an empty spot on the 3x3 grid. 
Once you have chosen a spot on the grid an X will appear on the spot you chose. 
Next, the computer will choose an empty spot and place an O.
The goal is to connect 3 Xs in a row and use strategy to prevent your oppenent from connecting 3 Os in a row. 

Basic game of tic-tac-toe where you will have a 3x3 grid where you (player 1)
will compete against the computer (player 2) to connect 3 in a row.

### Post-MVP Plans

XXX Replace the text below as you list with your own text then delete this line. XXX

- I would have liked to make the browser game more responsive.
- Another that will be a stretch having the game keep score and putting in a restart button.
- Something else I don't technically know how to do yet is have the game keep score.
